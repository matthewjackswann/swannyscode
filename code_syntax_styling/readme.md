Modified version of [one-dark](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax) and [one-light](https://github.com/atom/one-light-syntax) made for the atom editor.

Both ***syntax-styles-light.css*** and ***syntax-styles-dark.css*** should be compiled from the respective .less files and placed into the public folder

Changes made to the styles with be reflected in both the light and dark mode, so that only the initial colour variables make a difference.
