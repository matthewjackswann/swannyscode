const Component = () => {
    return <div>
        This is work in progress. It still needs css adding and I've not got round to it yet and it's probably the most
        boring part of the project. I've also not fully checked all the javascript fetches to ensure they work and
        gracefully handle errors.
    </div>
}

export default Component;
