const Component = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h3>Code Syntax Highlighting</h3>
            <p>
                I've noticed that the code on my website doesn't always load with syntax highlighting. I'm going to try
                and fix this when I next have time so my code looks prettier. It usually loads if you simply refresh the page.
            </p>
        </div>
    );

export default Component;
