        For the theme "My Eutopia", me and my friends created ASDA, The Anti-Seagull - Defence Apparatus. This was a joke project covering lots of different aspect that we wanted to work on and we ended up winning the "Peoples' Choice" category. Using react we created a webpage that showed videos of seagulls flying. When clicked, the seagull would be removed from the video (using tensorflow.js). The idea was that players would score points however due to the time limits, lack of good seagull videos, and stress from university modules we never realized its full potential. The full code can be found on <a className="tc underline hover:text-primary dark:hover:text-primary-dark" href="https://github.com/mitchLui/asda">github</a>
