        Our submission for the CSS x Boeing Hackathon 2022 with the theme of "Sustainable Cities and Communities". We created a navigation platform that aggregates data from 3rd party APIs and provides real-time information nearby forms of transport. When showing directions multiple forms of transport are shown with a predicted cost and CO2 emissions. We sadly didn't win any prizes but did receive an honourable mention and were invited to showcase our work at a local environmental showcase.
